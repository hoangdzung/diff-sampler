# diff-sampler
diff-sampler is an open source toolbox for fast sampling of diffusion models, with various model implementations, numerical-based solvers, time schedules and other features. 
This repository also includes (or will include) the official implementations of the following works:

- [ ] [A Geometric Perspective on Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19947)
- [x] [CVPR 2024] [Fast ODE-based Sampling for Diffusion Models in Around 5 Steps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00094)
- [ ] [ICML 2024] [On the Trajectory Regularity of ODE-based Diffusion Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11326)

## News
- **2024-06-03**. The repo is made easier to use. Now the pre-trained models will be automatically downloaded to `./src/dataset_name`. Some errors and typos are fixed. Detailed running scripts are provided in `launch.sh`, where we also add new scripts for evaluation of CLIP score for Stable Diffusion.
- **2024-05-02**. Our work [On the Trajectory Regularity of ODE-based Diffusion Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11326) is accepted by ICML 2024.
- **2024-03-25**. The official implementation of the paper [Fast ODE-based Sampling for Diffusion Models in Around 5 Steps](./amed-solver-main/) and a [toolbox](./diff-solvers-main/) for fast sampling of diffusion models is released. We upload the reference statistics for FID evaluation [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f8qf5qtUewCdDrkExK_Tk5-qC-fNPKpL?usp=sharing). Hope that this repo can facilitate researchers on fast sampling of diffusion models!
- **2024-02-27**. Our work [Fast ODE-based Sampling for Diffusion Models in Around 5 Steps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00094) is accepted by CVPR 2024.
